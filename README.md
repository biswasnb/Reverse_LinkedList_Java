# Reverse_LinkedList_Java

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates how to reverse a singly linked list using an iterative approach. The program creates a linked list, prints it, reverses it, and then prints the reversed list.

---

## Description

- Each node contains integer data and a reference to the next node.
- The `reverse()` method uses three pointers: `prev`, `current`, and `next` to reverse the links.
- The `printList()` method prints the elements of the linked list from head to tail.
